# utils
A bucket for any miscelaneous code that I write as part of my game development. 
Will possible (probably) be split and cleaned up as needed. 

## dialogue_manager
WIP
Will contain data manager, and file readers and writers for dialogue. Effectively a graph where each vertex is a participant's dialogue, and each edge a possible choice for the player.

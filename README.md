# utils
A bucket for any miscellaneous code that I write as part of my game development. 
Will possible (probably) be split and cleaned up as needed. 

Requires CMake to build, and Conan for dependencies. Current dependencies are

* gtest/1.8.1
* jsonformoderncpp/3.7.2

## dialogue_manager
WIP

Will contain data manager, and file readers and writers for dialogue. Effectively a graph where each vertex is a participant's dialogue, and each edge a possible choice for the player.
